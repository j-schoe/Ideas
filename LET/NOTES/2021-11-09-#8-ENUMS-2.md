# Enums

## Example

```
type Gender = enum {
  with let None   = new { Name = "Prefer Not To Say" }
  with let Female = new { Name = "Female" }
  with let Male   = new { Name = "Male" }
  with let Other  = record(override let Name :String)
  
  let Name :String
}
```

```
Gender.None         is Gender and Gender.Constant
Gender.Female       is Gender and Gender.Constant
Gender.Male         is Gender and Gender.Constant
Gender.Other        is Gender.Constant
Gender.Other("n/b") is Gender

Gender.Other("n/b").companion === Gender.Other
Gender.Other("n/b").companion.companion === Gender

Gender.Female.companion === Gender
```
Transpiled
```
type Gender = sealed {
  
  permits auto
  extends Enum
  
  override type Constant = selaed {
    permits None.type
    permits Female.type
    permits Male.type
    permits Other.type
  }
  
  override let Constants :Collect.Immutable.Set(Constant) = (None, Female, Male, Other)
  
  let None = new {
    extends Gender.Constant
    extends Gender
    override let Name = "Prefer Not To Say"
  }
  
  let Female = new {
    extends Gender.Constant
    extends Gender
    override let Name = "Female"
  }
  
  let Male = new {
    extends Gender.Constant
    extends Gender
    override let Name = "Male"
  }
  
  type Other = record {
    companion extends Gender.Constant
    extends Gender
    override let Name :String
  }
  
}
