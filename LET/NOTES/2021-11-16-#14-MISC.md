# Misc Thoughts

```
type T = primitive class {}
```

```
macro let {
  takes righthand let Symbol :SymbolLike
  returns :Binding
}
```

```
import actors...
type Counter = actor class {
  let Init  :Int32 def 0
  let Limit :Int32 def Max

  let Reached = event { receive, private send }

  private let i :mut Int32 def Init

  on Inc(let Amount: Int32) {
    let a = set self.i = { min(it + Amount, self.Limit) }
    if a === self.Limit then {
      self.Reached()
    }
  }
}
```

```
type Mutable = trait {
  expose let Get aka get :() -> T
  expose let Set aka set :T -> ()
}
// expose is like private but can be
// "overwritten" with something else
// on use side?
```
