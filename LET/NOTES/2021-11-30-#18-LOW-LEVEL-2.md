# Low Level Let (Ink)

## Type Overview

```
///  An object directly allocated on stack
///  or embeded in another object.
let Inline(let Class :Class) :Layout

///  A reference to an object allocated on the heap.
///  The reference to the object is exclusive.
///  Copying the reference causes the object to be cloned?
///  Borrowing is allowed.
/// # Takes [Trait]
///  The interface the referee has to satisfy.
/// # Takes [Pointer]
///  The layout of the reference.
let Unique(let Trait :Type, let Pointer :Layout extends Pointer = Runtime@inject.Pointer) :ReferenceLayout

///  A reference to an object allocated on the heap.
///  The reference to the object is shared.
///  The exact garbage collection model is runtime specific.
/// # Takes [Trait]
///  The interface the referee has to satisfy.
/// # Takes [Pointer]
///  The layout of the reference.
let Shared(let Trait :Type, let Pointer :Pointeroid = Runtime@inject.Pointer) :ReferenceLayout

///  A reference to an object allocated somewhere.
///  The reference must not outlive the referenced object.
/// # Takes [Trait]
///  The interface the referee has to satisfy.
/// # Takes [Pointer]
///  The layout of the reference.
let Borrowed(let Trait :Type, let Pointer :Pointeroid = Runtime@inject.Pointer) :ReferenceLayout
```

## Meta Types

```
Assert (Class  extends Type)
Assert (Layout extends Class)
```

## Shared By Default

When not other specified all interface references are `Shared`.

```
fun Foo(let Name :unique String) :Unit = {}

let name :/*shared*/ String = "Alice"
Foo(name)
```

What happens? Naively I'd say:

If the reference is known to be exclusive to `name`
(at runtime), and it is known that it won't be used anymore,
the reference can be passed to the function as it is.

Otherwise it must be copied and thus the referee cloned.

Eh? No.


## Additional Parameters

The `Shared` layout type might be additionally
parameterized with a garbage collector?


```
let s1 :Shared(String) = "Hello"
let s2 :Shared(String, Collector = myGC) = "World"
let s3 :Shared(String, Allocator = myAl) = ":D"
```

```
let Shared {
  takes let Trait     :Type
  given let Pointer   :PointerLayout
  given let Allocator :Allocator
  given let Collector :Collector
  is ReferenceLayout
}
```
