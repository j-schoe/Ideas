# Yielding

## Synchronous Yields

The synchronous `yield` is used to return a
value early from a function.

```
fun MakeIntPair(): (Int, Int) = {
  SideEffect1()
  yield 17
  SideEffect2()
  yield -3
  SideEffect3()
}
```
Is equal to:
```
fun MakeInkPair(): (Int, Int) = {
  SideEffect1()
  SideEffect2()
  SideEffect3()
  return (17, -3)
}
```

### Named Yields

```
type Person = record {
  let Firstname: String
  let Lastname:  String
  let Birthdate: Date? = None
}

fun MakePerson(): Person = {
  SideEffect1()
  yield Firstname = "Jane"
  SideEffect2()
  yield Lastname = "Doe"
  SideEffectE()
}
```
Is equal to:
```
fun MakePerson(): Person = {
  SideEffect1()
  SideEffect2()
  SideEffect3()
  return new {
    Firstname = "Jane"
    Lastname  = "Doe"
  }
}
```

## Asynchronous Yields

Some asynchronous factories override the yield
symbol. The asynchronous `yield` immediately
returns the value to the caller and suspends
the execution of the function until the next
value is required.
