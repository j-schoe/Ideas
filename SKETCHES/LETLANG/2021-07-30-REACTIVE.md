# Reactive

```
let x: reactiveMutable Int32 = 2
let y: reactiveMutable Int32 = -3
let z: reactive Int32 = (x* + y*)

WriteLine(z)
//> -1

set x = 28
WriteLine(z)
//> 25
```

## UI

```
let counter: reactiveMutable Int32 = 0

let d: reactive HTMLElement = Div {
  Children = Text("Clicked " ++ counter* ++ " times.")
  OnClick = {
    set counter = { it + 1 }
  }
}
```

## As Mutables

```
let x: mutable Int32 = 0
let y: reactive Int32 = x* ** 2

WriteLine(y)
//> 0

set x = 2
WriteLine(y)
//> 4
```


## Laziness

```
let x: mutable Int32 = 0
let y: reactive Int32 = run {
  WriteLine("from run: " ++ x*)
  return x* + 2
}

WriteLine(y)
//> from run: 0
//> 2

set x = 6

WriteLine(y)
//> from run: 6
//> 8

WriteLine(y)
// will it be evaluated again?
// or is kept cached?

```
