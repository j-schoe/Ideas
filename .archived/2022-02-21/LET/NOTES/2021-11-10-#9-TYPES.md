# Types

## Generic Functions: Ambient Parameters

### Definition

```
// after, with braces
fun Foo[type T](let It: T): T = It

// after, with keyword
fun Foo(with type T)(let It: T): T = It

// before, with braces
fun [type T] Foo(let It: T): T = It

// before, with parenthesis
fun (type T) Foo(let It: T): T = It
```

### Calling

```
// with braces
Foo[Int32](17)

// with keyword
Foo(with Int32)(17)
```

## Generic Types

```
type Pair = record {
  // type members
  type Left
  type Right
  
  // type usage
  let Left  :Left
  let Right :Right
  
  // parameterization
  this(Left, Right)
}
```

## Generic Companions!?

Is `List(String) === List(Int32)`?
What about associated objects?

### Never Parameterize Companions?

Which means `List(String).Create()` will not be a thing?

### Type Parameters Become Associated Types

```
type Pair = record {
  type Left
  type Right
  
  let Left  :Left
  let Right :Right
  
  // for the companion the types
  // become associcated objects.
  // which are like annotations
  // to the companion object.
  // they might be present or not.
  // which is statically known!
  // their usage must be declared!
  using (Left, Right)
  fun Of(let Left :Left, let Right :Right) :Pair =
    new { Left, Right }
}
```
