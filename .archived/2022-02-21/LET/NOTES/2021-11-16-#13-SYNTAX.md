# Misc. Syntax

## Parallel Assignment
```
let X, let Y = 7, -13
(let Width = X, let Height = Y) = (X = 640, Y = 480)
```

## Duplicate Assignment
```
let X aka Width  :Float32
let Y aka Height :Float32
```

## Named Tuples vs. Records

Tuple literals are always indexed.
```
("Hello", "World").1
```
It's the type that has no index.
```
record {
  let First  :String
  let Second :String
}
```

```
let value1 = ("Hello", "World")
let value2 = value1 :(let Firstname :String, let Lastname :String)
let value2 = value2 :record { let Firstname :String, let Lastname :String }
```

## Operator Splitting

Parse `x?+-y` as `x? + -y`?

## Named Matching

```
(Width = 7, Height = -3) apply {
  let w = Width, let h = Height -> w * w + h * h
}
(Width = 7, Height = -3) apply {
  Width as let w, Height as let h -> w * w + h * h
}
```
